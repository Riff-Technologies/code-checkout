To ensure the final technical plan for your codecheckout npm package meets all your expectations and can be implemented without unknowns, here are a few clarifying questions:

General Questions:

1. Target Environment:
   • The package should target all javascript/typescript projects if possible

2. Dependency Management:
   • Prefer dependencies that are built in, and then prefer dependencies that will work across environments.

logAnalyticsEvent Function:

3. Function Behavior:
   • Analytics function should not produce logs

4. Metadata Requirements:
   • The machineId should be used for tracking the use of the license if possible. sessionId is a nice-to-have.

5. Error Handling:
   • It should return immediately.

⸻

Validate License:

6. Caching Mechanism:
   • It should use the most flexible option, possibly by requiring the user to inject a storage dependency.

7. Cache Expiry:
   • The default grace period should be 3 days and should be customizable, including 0 grace period.

8. Default Validation Logic:
   • Unless the developer specifies otherwise with an argument, the license validation should be "offline-first", meaning if the use is within the grace period, it should return valid immediately and then make a request to the server in the background and cache that the license was validated successfully, or it was deemed invalid. It should also consider that there may be server errors which do not mean that the license is invalid.

9. Machine and Session IDs:
   • The package should include built-in generation logic for the machineId and sessionId.

Checkout URL Generation:

9. License Key Generation:
   • It is only meant for internal use and should not be exposed publicly. The license key that was generated should be returned as a tuple along with the URL, e.g. { licenseKey: string, url: string }

10. Success and Cancel URLs:
    • These URLs should always be customizable, but have default values.

11. Checkout URL Test Mode:
    • The testMode should always be explicitly specified.

Package Implementation Details:

12. Authentication:
    • For license validation, the licenseKey will be passed as the Authorization header, and no other authorization is required for other API requests.

13. API Server Base URL:
    • NODE_ENV can be used to set the base URL, but it should be overridable.

Implementation Preferences:

14. Configuration and Initialization:
    • It would be preferred that a one-time configuration is done, but perhaps allowing the functions to accept the configuration params so that they can be used without a configuration step would be nice-to-have.

15. Logging:
    • Logging should be done with the default logging system of the environment, and should be more verbose in dev mode than in production.
